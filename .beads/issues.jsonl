{"id":"gremlin-hxq","title":"wizardshit.ai MVP: Effect-TS Video Blog Platform","description":"Build MVP for wizardshit.ai - a video blog platform with Mux video hosting, BetterAuth (GitHub only), Next.js 16 RSC/Cache Components, and an Effect-TS router pattern inspired by uploadthing/trpc. TDD-first approach with CLI-first CMS. Spiritual successor to coursebuilder.\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n### Router Pattern (uploadthing-inspired)\n- `createWizardshit()` returns fluent builder: `.input().middleware().handler()`\n- `createRouteHandler()` returns `{ GET, POST }` for Next.js App Router\n- Effect-TS for service layer with dependency injection via Context.Tag\n- Typed client inference for end-to-end type safety\n\n### Key References\n- uploadthing: packages/uploadthing/src/_internal/upload-builder.ts (builder pattern)\n- uploadthing: packages/uploadthing/src/_internal/handler.ts (Effect HttpRouter)\n- coursebuilder: packages/core/src/lib/index.ts (router dispatch)\n- coursebuilder: packages/adapter-drizzle/src/lib/mysql/schemas/content/ (data model)\n\n### Tech Stack\n- Bun runtime + Turborepo\n- Effect-TS for services, errors, DI\n- BetterAuth with GitHub OAuth\n- Drizzle + SQLite (local) / Turso (prod)\n- Mux for video hosting\n- Next.js 16 with RSC + Cache Components\n\n### TDD Approach\n- Tests first for all core logic\n- MemoryAdapter for database testing\n- Mocked Mux API for video tests\n- Characterization tests for legacy pattern extraction","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-16T12:33:23.714672-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-16T12:33:23.714672-08:00"}
